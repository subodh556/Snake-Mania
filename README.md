# Snake-Mania
### Snake-Mania is a classic video game where the player controls a snake that moves around a board collecting food and growing in length. The objective of the game is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body while collecting as much food as possible.

Snake-Mania made using JavaScript typically consists of a  game board, and JavaScript code that controls the movement and behavior of the snake. The snake is made up of a series of squares that move in a particular direction, and the player controls the direction of the snake using arrow keys on their keyboard.

When the snake collides with a wall or its own body, the game is over and the player's score is displayed on the screen. The score is determined by the number of pieces of food the snake has collected, with each piece adding a certain number of points to the score.
